<h2> Would you like to support this community inspired project?</h2>

<p>150,000 Photos, 1200 hours shooting and editing, 1200 miles walked, nearly 775 dogs, over several thousand 'sessions' in 2024, I was lucky to meet over 1000 people, 100 dogs attended my open studios and the holiday wreath sessions, over 1000 hashtag free instagram posts, and nearly 4000 photos published to the Jamaica Plain Dogs website, Thousands of photos in private Flickr albums where each family was able to pick their favorites and download the full size digital images freely, and around 350 or so prints given away to our Jamaica Plain dog families. The scale of this project feels a little staggering. It was only possible because of the support of every single person I met.</p>

<p>If you would like to support the project: for what was achieved in 2024, what we might be able achieve in 2025, or just think my approach to this project is pretty cool, there are now a few ways.</p>

<ul>
<li>Prints: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jamaicaplainphotos/" target="_blank">Jamaica Plain Photos</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jamaicaplaindogs/" target="_blank"> Jamaica Plain Dogs</a> prints can be ordered by request, I especially recommend the crane photos, I printed one for myself at 18x24 and it is pretty awesome.</li>

<li>Venmo: <a href="https://www.venmo.com/u/jamaicaplaindogs" target="_blank"> @jamaicaplaindogs</a>.</li>

<li>Join Jamaica Plain Dogs on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/JamaicaPlainDogs" target="_blank">Patreon</a>. If there is sufficient interest on Patreon, I plan to publish frequent posts about specific photos, personal project milestones from 2024 and my hopes for 2025. This will require me to get a lot more comfortable with writing. I am keeping the monthly price at the lowest possible of $1 because I really would like to make sure everyone has access to all the posts, and it will be much better experience on Patreon.</li>
