<h2>Breed / age / how old was Jasper when you got him?</h2>
<p>Airedale Terrier + Standard Poodle. Got him at 10 weeks old from Michigan</p>

<h2>Nicknames?</h2>
<p>JJ, Goob/goober</p>

<h2>Tell me about what makes Jasper special, something like their silliness, playfulness, athleticism, intelligence, or something that surprises and delights you.</h2>
<p>Jasper is smart in his own way and likes to come up with his own games/habits. He created a hide-and-seek game where he'd run to the bathroom and hide in the bathtub, bark once, then wait for me to come and pull back the curtain. Then his bedtime routine includes him having to carry his blanket from the living room to his bed in the bedroom. </p>




<h2>How would you describe some of Jasper's most prominent personality traits?</h2> 
<p>Muppet-ity and dapper all at the same time - though visually very obvious when he goes from his winter hair to his summer cut. He is always very curious, which doesn't help that he has super long legs and can get into almost everything.</p>



<h2>How does Jasper's personality suit you, and how much are you alike? Are there attributes Jasper has that you wish you had more of? </h2>
<p>Jasper has for better or worse taken on my laziness skills and desire to sleep in! He has learned to ignore the alarm (plus a few snoozes) and then will come snuggle before he gets up. He also does not like the heat, so enjoys walks but is happy to have a short casual walk and get back inside. He is a dog that likes smaller dog groups or one-on-one hang outs much like me. I will say, one thing I'd love to get from Jasper is ability, willingness, and joy of meeting new people and dogs. </p>



<h2>What was Jasper like as a puppy, and how has he changed over time? </h2>
<p>As a pup, he was a little rolly-polly puppy super eager to run with the big dogs but had zero control of his limbs. He is still super eager to by friends but either just casually hangs out or leads the running groups. </p>



<h2>What makes Jasper happy? </h2>
<p>Being with me or his favorite humans and dog friends. Playing with his favorite toy - his green ball he got from Grandma</p>



<h2>Does Jasper have a certain play style</h2>
<p>In the house, he loves playing tug or fetch with his favorite green ball though he usually refuses to drop it. Outside with other pups, he's all about the wrestling and ear nibbling. With all humans, he loves to rub his head against hips and then pushing his way between legs to get butt scratches. Regardless of human or dog friends, he loves to bark to get attention.</p>



<h2>How did your life change when you got Jasper? </h2>
<p>Definitely took a little bit to get used to the responsibility, but it was for the best! Hardest thing for me was the fact I could no longer be as spontaneous or nomadic as I had been prior to Jasper. I used to travel all the time, whether for work or for fun, and would focus on that instead of building roots and a community in my neighborhood. Honestly, having him has really helped me grow a community that is not just based on frisbee or work, get to meet a lot of people with different lifestyles, professions, stages in their lives. I was brand new to JP, moved April 2020, didn't know anyone and the pandemic. My parents decided I needed a dog for my birthday and so Jasper became part of my life. He made me walk the neighborhood, be outgoing and meet new people, and most of all build a new community amongst other dogs and their parents.</p>



<h2>What do you see when you look at Jasper? </h2>
<p>Goofy, happy, loving pupper </p>



<h2>Did you grow up with dogs? How is it different now? </h2>
<p>I did grow up with dogs and absolutely loved having them including being a part of their training and responsibility. Being around and having animals was always something important for me and always knew I'd have a dog of my own. Jasper was my 30th birthday gift from my parents, which was great and super nice of them, but then I realized how much actually goes into training, supporting, and taking care of dogs. Biggest thing for me now is accepting my limits and willingness to put into training Jasper. He is a very opinionated, inquisitive, goober of a dog who may never be an off leash dog, a brewery companion, or able to hang at other people's houses and at the end of the day, that is totally okay because he's well loved, has all the toys he wants, and is a happy boy.</p>



<h2>Does Jasper have a pack and or a best friend: </h2>
<p>Yes, both a human pack and dog pack. Human pack: Erika, Rachel, Mark, Colleen (neighbor) and Nathan (dog sitter). His best paw-friends are Simba (more like his older brother who ignores him), Sophie, and Eddie. He does love meeting most new dogs and will always be happy going on a pack walk.</p>



<h2>What does having a dog pack/dog parent community mean to you?</h2> 
<p>It's become super important for me as I grew up in a close-knit neighborhood knowing everyone  within blocks of me (and their dogs) and Jasper has helped make JP feel similar. We can walk around the neighborhood and are almost guaranteed to run into someone from our pack. Just really has made this area feel more like a home versus a place I happen to live. </p>
