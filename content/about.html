<h2>Dogs are a vital part of a healthy community.</h2>

<p>I have met and photographed nearly 580 dogs, in a spontaneous way, almost all while walking my own 3 year old golden retriever. Over 1400 photo sessions around the streets and parks of Jamaica Plain. The response within the community has been wonderful.</p>

<h2>How Jamaica Plain Dogs got started.</h2>

<p>On February 24th 2024, I photographed Sophie on a walk in the arboretum. A few days later I asked some of the dog parents I had known for a while if I could also photograph their dogs. Photography has been one of my main passions since 1999. </p>

<p>In that first week, I also photographed <a href="/albums/alo/" target="_blank">Aloo</a> and <a href="/albums/roman" target="_blank">Roman</a>, their parents were very gracious allowing me to take some photos. I also met Kupo, Leia, Toby, Darby and Delta that first week, as well as three other dogs whose names I sadly don't have. (This was before I was writing down the names). If it hadn't been for their kindness, I dont know where the project would be today.</p>

<p>By the second week of March, the project as it is known now was really on a roll. It became a nice way to spread a little joy and fun for the dog people in Jamaica Plain.</p>
